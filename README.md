In this project we can run the file name (irclient.py) which make the victim think that they are using irc chatting client but  in the background the decrypt.py (version 4) is downloaded and executed and when completed a email containing Subject the name of the victim and the browser they are using to my gmail id and atlast it alson deletes the irclient.py file thus leaving no digital footprints. Please Dont use this for any malicious purpose . I made this project just for fun.(Use it at your own risk i take no crediility for any harm done :) )
